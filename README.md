# ML-Perceptrons-as-Logical-Operators-Not-
#Unlike the other perceptrons we looked at, the NOT operation only cares about one input. The operation returns a 0 if the input is 1 and a 1 if it's a 0. The other inputs to the perceptron are ignored.

In this quiz, We'll set the weights (weight1, weight2) and bias bias to the values that calculate the NOT operation on the second input and ignores the first input.
